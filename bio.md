Kyle Kelley writes software, sneaks in security tomfoolery, and dabbles in as many open source projects as possible. As a developer support engineer, he devotes much of the day to helping customers with APIs and SDKs, infrastructure design, and not hanging themselves the clouds. On the side he does ops work for various open source projects, including their build infrastructure and public facing sites. He also loves strange bugs, who doesn't?
