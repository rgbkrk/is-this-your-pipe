### Speaker Bio

Kyle Kelley is a software engineer at Rackspace who does developer support, sneaks in security tomfoolery, and works on open source projects including IPython and the scientific Python ecosystem. He loves strange bugs. On the side he does ops work for various open source projects, including their build infrastructure and public facing sites.

### Abstract

Developers on the web rely heavily on web infrastructure that is out of their control nowadays. Packages get pulled from Ruby gems, PyPI, and npm. Chef cookbooks get pulled from GitHub to build millions of nodes every day. Builds happen on Travis CI or Jenkins. The dependencies are all over the place.

As web developers, we rely on tools to automate building code, running tests, and even deploying services. What happens when you're too trusting of CI/CD pipelines? Come hijack credentials out of repositories, steal hidden and encrypted secrets using builds, and hijack infrastructure via *their* continuous deployment.
